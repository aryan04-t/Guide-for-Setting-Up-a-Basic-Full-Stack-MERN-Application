# <span style="color: lightblue"> Downloading Few Basic NPM Packages for Backend: </span> 


- We have downloaded 2 packages until now for backend, ``` nodemon ``` as a dev dependency, and ``` express ``` for running our basic server code that we wrote in the beginning. 

- When we're building Full Stack Application, many more packages are used for building the complete app, right now I am building a "Chat Application" and for that I am downloading these npm packages also: 

1. dotenv 
2. cookie-parser 
3. bcryptjs 
4. cors 
5. mongoose 
6. socket.io 
7. jsonwebtoken
