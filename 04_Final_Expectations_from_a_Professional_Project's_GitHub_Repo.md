## <span style="color: lightgreen"> Code Base Point of View: </span> 

0. Neat and clean directory structure 
1. Code should be modular and well decoupled, the code base should not be violating the DRY (Do not Repeat Yourself) principle of coding 
2. Clean code and consistent, easily understandable and logical naming conventions throughout the code base 
3. Well implemented functionalities 
4. Error handling should be done through out the code base 
5. Smooth and consistent UI and UX should be there 
6. No warnings and error should be their in the code base (Try not to use deprecated packages) 
7. Always handle all the input fields nicely, they should only accept valid data, and error message should be show to the user in case of invalid data input 
8. Login and Sign Up should work totally smoothly, Authentication and Authorization should be there in the project 
9. Testing should always be done really well 
10. And always have .gitignore file for ignoring the node_modules at least 



## <span style="color: lightgreen"> GitHub Repo Overview Point of View: </span> 

* So, the code base part of your GitHub repo is described above pretty well, all the above things should be followed to keep your code base's quality high, now let's talk about other aspects of your GitHub repository 

* Description of your GitHub Repository: 
    - A well written "About" section of project should be there for the GitHub Repository 

* README.md File should be present: 

    - README file should have all the valid and relevant information about the project like: 

        1. Describe the project  
        2. Project's live demo video's link should be present with your face, clear audio, and screen recoding included obviously (Video should not be no longer than 2 mins, put it on google drive, and make the link public, and add the link in the README file of the project)  
        3. Deploy you Project:  
            - Don't forget to deploy your project, and provide the deployed link in the README file  
        4. Design file of the Project  
        5. Setup and Run Instructions, and Necessary Environment Configuration Instructions should be there  
        6. Third Party API Usage Acknowledgement:  
            - If you have used third party APIs you can explain which ones you have used, why you have used them, and you can also provide links of them  
        7. API documentation:  
            - API documentation should be their in the README file, (Postman makes it really easy to do API documentation, I personally use it, you can also use it if you want)  
            - In API documentation, API route descriptions with expected inputs and outputs along with the logic should be present there  
        8. Show API Interaction:  
            - Include a Postman collection (JSON exported) on GitHub to show API interaction keep this JSON saved as apiInteraction.json in your project's repo  
            - Don't forget to mention this in the README file that what is apiInteraction.json in your code base
